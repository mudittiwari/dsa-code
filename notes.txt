1. DOUBLE POINTER USE TO SHIFT NEGATIVE ELEMENTS ONE SIDE AND POSITIVE ELEMENTS THE OTHER SIDE
THIS APPROACH WILL MINIMIZE THE USE OF EXTRA MEMORY 

STEPS::
1. we first initialized the two pointers left and right with first element and last element respectively.
2. then we followed three steps::
    1. if the left and right elements are positive we simply decrease the right pointer
    2. if the left and right elements are negative we simply increase the left pointer
    3. if the left element is positive and the right element is negative we simply swap them.
    4. we do this approach till the right and left pointer becomes same.
    
2. FACTORIAL OF A LARGE NUMBER

STEPS::
1. we used array to store the every digit of the answer.
2. we stored the answer in reverse order in the array so that when we do next multiplication we can easily add the carry at the end of the array.
3. we start a loop from 2 to n and make a array with 1 in it and every time initialize the carry with one.
4. now we iterate the array and multiply its every number with the X(next number in the factorial) and use the formula to find the
product  product=X*arr[i] + carry;
5. now if the product is one digit we replace the arr[i] with the product
6. else we replace the arr[i] with the last digit of the product and append the carry with the remaining digits.
          arr[i]=product%10;
          carry=product/10;
7. now when we reach the last number of the array we simpy append the array with the carry digits.
